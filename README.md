# Hypixel-rank-sync

Syncs the rank from hypixel to the
rank on your smp server

NO OTHER PLUGINS ARE NEEDED

# how to use:
put plugin in plugins folder
run /reload or restart server
open the config and paste your hypixel api key 
then run /rs reload to reload the config 
you should be all set!

to toggle the guild rank tag just type /rs guild rank <true/false>

# warning:
you might have issues with rate limits if more than 1 person is joining per second or 60 per min 
as everytime a player joins the server the api is sent 2 requests and the rate limit is 120 per min

if you want you can change the code to support a list of api keys or i can figure it out in the future
